    <h1>Leg of Lamb With Garlic and Rosemary</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A good roast leg of lamb recipe should be both simple and impressive, something you can serve to guests on Easter or Passover that is also easy enough to make for a special Sunday dinner. This version, flavored with just garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper is just that. (It also has hundreds of reviews from cooks who say it works well, even if you are new to cooking lamb.) You do not have to sear it or worry over a fussy marinade—and the hands-on time is just about 15 minutes.</p>
    <p>This recipe uses a semi-boneless leg, which means the shank and blade bones have been removed, but the leg bone, which adds a lot of flavor, is still in the roast. This helps hold the meat together, so you do not have to tie it up, while making it easier to carve than a fully bone-in leg of lamb. It also cuts down on cooking time. The cut has a fairly uniform shape, so it is easy to roast to your desired doneness; if you insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part, the rest of the leg will be fairly close to that same temperature. To serve, transfer the lamb to a platter and tuck some fresh, fragrant oregano or rosemary sprigs around the roast for a pretty but easy presentation, and pour a sauce made from the drippings into a small bowl for guests to spoon over individual slices.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (7-pound) semi-boneless leg of lamb, aitchbone removed, fat trimmed to ¼ inch thick, and lamb tied</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry red wine or broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat lamb dry and score fat by making shallow cuts all over with tip of a sharp small knife.</li>
        <li>Pound garlic to a paste with sea salt using a mortar and pestle (or mince and mash with a heavy knife) and stir together with rosemary and pepper. Put lamb in a lightly oiled roasting pan, then rub paste all over lamb. Let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Roast lamb in middle of oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted 2 inches into thickest part of meat (do not touch bone) registers 130°F, 1½ to 1¾ hours. Transfer to a cutting board and let stand 15 to 25 minutes (internal temperature will rise to about 140°F for medium-rare).</li>
        <li>Add wine to pan and deglaze by boiling over moderately high heat, stirring and scraping up brown bits, 1 minute. Season pan juices with salt and pepper and serve with lamb.</li>
    </ol>
